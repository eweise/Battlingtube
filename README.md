Battlingtube
=======================================================

This project is an old website idea I had to have users create battles of related video and vote for their favorites.
The site had modest success (a few thousand users) but it eventually became too much work so I shut it down.  The source
code is up on github in case it may help someone with writing a grails app. The code is a few years old though, so grails
coding patterns may have changed.
